# 2017-HIV-Prevalence-Case-Study

*This repository was created for use by CDC programs to collaborate on public health surveillance related projects in support of the CDC Surveillance Strategy. Github is not hosted by the CDC, but is used by CDC and its partners to share information and collaborate on software.*

Case studies have been used in many disciplines (health sciences, social sciences, engineering and law) to create opportunities to provide learners with immersive environments in which to apply these problem solving skills. Digital case studies provide the additional benefits of interactivity and reproducibility to data science problems, but educators be faced with challenges understanding the ecosystem of tools that can be used to develop them. Over the course of the next few hours, you and your team will develop a simple digital case study based on publically-available data from Botswana.

## Interact with the Case Study
[![Binder](https://beta.mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://beta.mybinder.org/v2/gh/PHI-Case-Studies/2019-HIV-Prevalence-Botswana/master) 

This is a **digital case study** built with [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). Click on the Binder Notebook link above. Wait a few minutes for the Binder service to complete its setup and launch. Enjoy the rest of the story after you launch the case study.

## Notes
### Using BinderHub
After clicking on the "launch binder" link above, wait for a few minutes to have Docker container built.
